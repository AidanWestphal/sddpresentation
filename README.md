The following is an example of Dependency Injection for a Car class. The Car is the client and the Wheel is the subject. Wheel is represented as an abstract class and its implementations are its children. This is because I found it necessary that Wheels have class variables, such as their lifespan. Two types of Wheel are given (RoundWheel and SquareWheel) and their associated injectors are provided.
